## About Me
I'm always looking for something new and exciting to build. Whether it be a new approach to project management applications (which is my current final year project) or creating a communications modification to enhance in-game experience (another one of my side projects).

## Current Studies
I currently study __Creative Media Technologies__ at _Leeds Beckett University_ and am in my final year.

### What happened during my years at University?
1. Studied a Semester Abroad - __St. PÃ¶lten, Austria__
1. 3 Years a member - __Leeds Ethical Hacking Society__ - 1 Year running the media department as committee member


## But What am I really worth?
