# The Production of the CT WordPress Theme(s)
This was a development project done for _[Correct Translations](http://www.ct.ee)_ in partnership with _[Avocado](http://www.avocado.ee)_. My part on this project was as to produce a global theme, re-install WordPress from its Multi-site state to make it a single site. I was also liaising with the web hosting provider on this project due to specific requirements being needed during the initial re-installation of WordPress to ensure the transitions happened without any significant data loss.

We are unsure of how many releases were before this. However, this release is the point at which the site was when we were handed it. It was a WordPress Multisite with a whole new theme for each language, as can be seen in the themes directory where one can find the "`ct`", "`ct_en`", "`ct_rus`", "`ct_fi`" themes.

# Moving forward
It was therefore decided to issue a new installation of WordPress, which would not be a Multisite (as this appeared to be an extremely inefficient way of displaying different languages for the site) and would consist of only a single "ct" theme which would have all strings, file names, etc. be based off English, to standardise the language used for future developers.

## Translations
To translate the website, WPML and some of its module plugins would be used. The module plugins, including string and media translation, would help us translate not only the basic pages and posts, but also the strings built in to the theme and, if the situation required, media too.

## The theme
Making the theme much more flexible and customisable for the client was a top priority, on top of making the basic style and content changes originally requested by the client. With this in mind, we overhauled almost the entire theme, allowing for the future where features such as the client ribbon above the footer, CT's company details (displayed in the footer, header and on the contact page), etc. to be editable by the client or any future developers without the need to touch the template code.

As an example:

### What elements are flexible now?
1. Client logos are now generated depending on what files are on the filesystem in the theme "/img/clients/" folder. any files with "-OLD" appended to the filename are not included.
1. Company details (Name, Type, E-mail, Website, Copyright, Primary Phone Number, Secondary Phone Number, etc.)
1. String and Page translations (Using WPML)
