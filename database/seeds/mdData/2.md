# The Update of the Orangetime WordPress Theme
This was a development project done for _[Orangetime](http://www.orangetime.ee)_ in partnership with _[Avocado](http://www.avocado.ee)_. My parts on this project specifically included modifying the style of the theme on some pages, as well as adding a fully functioning blog.

## The Blog
Since there was other content previous to the beginning of the production of this site, the default WordPress blog system was already being used by this content. Instead of potentially polluting the existing content categories, I decided to make a Custom Post and its own Custom Category Taxonomy. This would keep the different content types completely separate and avoid any potential conflicts in the future.

## Conferences/Events Pages
Both pages "Event Marketing" and "Meetings and Conferences" were refactored slightly to apply style changes. The designs on which these changes were based were done by [Avocado](http://www.avocado.ee) and can be seen below.

The Designs can be compared to the result of the site

## Internationalising and Localising
The blog content was fully translatable (thanks to the installed WPML plguin), and any strings which were implemented in the entire site were internationalised by me to allow localisation.

I ended up localising the theme to Estonian myself, with the help of an Estonian native. The localisation was done using "POEdit", which is the recommended software by WordPress in generating localisation files (.po/.mo).

After generating these files, it was a simple matter of including them in the theme and adding them to WPML.


Wordpress development project done for a client. My parts in this included modifying the existing theme and added a fully functioning blog. Why didn't we just use the standard Wordpress blog posts system? That system was already occupied and required by the existing content.
