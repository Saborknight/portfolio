# The Update of the Orangetime WordPress Theme
This was a development project done for _[Orangetime](http://www.orangetime.ee)_ in partnership with _[Avocado](http://www.avocado.ee)_. They requested that the website have some changes be made to it in response to new designs submitted by the designer at Avocado. They further required that the website be extended to incorporate a fully functioning blog.

In order to achieve the above, there were a number of aspects to the development to consider:
1. The designs submitted by the Avocado designer needed to be incorporated to an existing theme.
1. How to extend the existing WordPress site to incorporate a blog.
1. What methods of content management would be developed which would allow non-technical clients to modify the translations of the site.


## The Blog
Since there was other content previous to the beginning of the production of this site, the default WordPress blog system was already being used by this content. Instead of potentially polluting the existing content categories, I decided to make a Custom Post and its own Custom Category Taxonomy. This would keep the different content types completely separate and avoid any potential conflicts in the future. This would create a separate section in the admin area of WordPress which would maintain a distinction between the blog posts and the other content of the site (which was at that time, conferences and events).

## Conferences/Events Pages
Both pages "Event Marketing" and "Meetings and Conferences" were refactored slightly to apply style changes. The designs on which these changes were based were done by [Avocado](http://www.avocado.ee) and can be seen below.

The Designs can be compared to the result of the site

## Internationalising and Localising
In order to allow the client to modify the translations of the entire site after the completion of development, I employed a WordPress plugin called "WPML". This plugin allowed the translation of the WordPress managed dynamic content, as well as the static internationalised strings which I had implemented in the PHP code of the theme itself. This meant that the client would have full control over all aspects of the literary content of the site.

During development we were unable to find an Estonian translator. Therefore I ended up localising the theme to Estonian myself, with the help of an Estonian native. The localisation was done using "POEdit", which is the recommended software by WordPress in generating localisation files (.po/.mo).

After generating these files, it was a simple matter of including them in the theme and adding them to WPML.


Wordpress development project done for a client. My parts in this included modifying the existing theme and added a fully functioning blog. Why didn't we just use the standard Wordpress blog posts system? That system was already occupied and required by the existing content.
