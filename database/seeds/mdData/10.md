# The Production of the 2BNB Extras Arma 3 mod
2BNB Extras is a gameplay enhancing mod intended to be used by a specific community of people. I head a team of collaborators who, like me, work on this mod in their free time. Contributions are made in C++ and in SQF (a C based proprietary scripting language for Arma 3), and we all work in a team, delegating our own tasks and using our initiative and mutual support to complete those tasks we create for ourselves.

## The Development
Working with my friends and co-modders, we created a library of functionality that would be added to the game to make the gameplay better/more immersive/more fluent and administration of missions and server easier to do. We also re-textured a number of vehicles and equipment by inheriting assets that either the game offers or that were included by other games.
