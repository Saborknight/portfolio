# The Production of the Leeds Beckett Student Union E-mail template
In my first year, the Student Union at Leeds Beckett University approached me regarding creating a custom HTML e-mail template which they could use in the future. They would provide the designs necessary for its development, and my part in the project was to develop the actual code which could later be imported to any newsletter distribution service, such as MailChimp.

## The Development
In this project I felt like I was thrown back into the stone age. In order for an HTML e-mail to look similar on all the e-mail clients used in the world, I was forced to revert back from HTML5 standards to old table/inline styling based development. As a result all the styles were inlined and the layout created using a solely table based layout, rather than the more modern div based.

As a fallback, in case the e-mail couldn't/was set not to display HTML e-mails, alternate body content was also included in the resultant project.
