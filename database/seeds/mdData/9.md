# The Production of the Three Counties Water Website
The Three Counties Water Website was a project started by another member of the team at Cefar before being handed over to me. The website is an informational site for a water treatment and health services company based near Northampton, UK.

## The Development
I received a bare-bones version of the theme from the team member who had been working on it, and built on top of this. The designs were created by our in-house designer, and I worked closely with him to ensure the navigational flow and animations were what he had envisioned whilst designing the website. Having said this, however, I did include little trinkets of animations that would react to user input, in order to bring the website to life. An example of this could be seen when hovering over the call to actions on the homepage.

Other features of the website on which I worked included the Google Maps integration, using a WordPress plugin with custom CSS to change it's overall appearance, sliders for collections of images using the [Slick](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) carousel slider, and all the other basic page template designs.
