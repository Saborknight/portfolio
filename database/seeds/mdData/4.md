# The Production of the Leeds Ethical Hacking Society Web Page
As part of my role as Public Relations Officer, I took on the role of creating a simple single page site. The main aim of this page was to display relevant information without having to open our hosting servers up to significant vulnerabilities by using an existing CMS (Like WordPress) or by using any server side languages. This was only meant to be a temporary solution whilst we developed our own, secure, dynamic website.

The webpage has since been taken down, and replaced with a placeholder page as the new committee is in the process of developing another website for the society.

## The Style
The style of the website was based largely off the society's "mascot", which also served as our logo. The colour scheme of black and yellow was chosen for having a large contrast and being present on the logo "mascot". The typeface "Ubuntu Mono" was chosen for it's monospace type and relation to Operating Systems.
