# The Production of the BETR WordPress conversion
There were two BETR websites produced whilst I worked for the foundation. The first was a static website that, although initially well designed, lacked the ability to be upscaled in functionality and, in some cases, in design.

## The Development
The second website was created with scalability in mind, both in terms of design and in terms of functionality. The design itself was created by another designer, with whom I liaised closely in order to ensure that all the assets that the designer handed over could be reused and moved around in the overall page designs. This was crucial in making sure any future alterations could be made rapidly and without too much to-and-fro between designer and developer.

In terms of functionality we decided to work with a framework to avoid re-inventing the wheel again. WordPress was chosen out of a list of candidates, using the [Underscores.me](http://underscores.me) base theme as the basis of our custom theme, as it was the framework I, and other members in the foundation were familiar with. This meant that, even if I were to leave (which I eventually did), other members of the foundation could take over without too much catching up.

Since the head of marketing would end up being the admin and main content curator of the website, I worked closely with her throughout the development process. Not only did she provide input into the design and usability of the public audience's end of the website, but also into the administration tools and the way the information was organised there. The intention was to make editing the content of the website, as streamlined as wordpress allowed.

This included the use of custom shortcodes to execute certain little bits of functionality here or there, and to standardise certain design elements. One of these design shortcoded design elements being an iconised link, allowing the editor the ability to choose what icon the link would have as well as up to 2 accompanying text elements - a title and subtitle. The button version of this was also created as a shortcode, though obviously this disregarded the icon or second text element and instead offered the choice of button types. Other shortcodes were also created with the same goal in mind - making the website as easy to edit and work with as possible.

Even though most of the people at the foundation were familiar with WordPress, I created and maintained an accompanying wiki to document those aspects of the website that were implemented in any different way to the usual WordPress functionality. This covered the custom posts, fields and shortcodes that were implemented and how to use them. This wiki was written with the marketing team as the intended audience, which meant breaking the instructions and explanations right down to the basics to ensure that any of the non-WordPress savvy members of the team could still understand and work with the information provided.


I also used several Wordpress plugins to aid in creating specific elements of the site as much as possible. This was done so as to limit the amount of custom code as much as possible, to make sure other members of the team had familiar interfaces to work with. This was especially true for those well established plugins on the WordPress plugins repository.

Plugins used:
[Contact Forms 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/) - Used for creating forms for the public to submit contact queries as well as job applications
[Toolset Types](https://toolset.com/) - Used to create and modify custom post types, fields, and taxonomies
[WPML Translation plugins](https://wpml.org/) - A series of plugins used for enabling translations of the website and all of its elements
[Yoast SEO Premium](https://yoa.st/2jc) - Used to allows the marketing team full control over the SEO elements of the website
[Wordfence Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/) - Used to secure the website beyond the existing framework's abilities

As well as other small site optimisation/caching plugins.
