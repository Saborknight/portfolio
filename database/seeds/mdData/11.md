# The Production of the 9Liners & Notepad Arma 3 mod
9Liners & Notepad is a mod intended to simulate a virtual notepad in-game to allow players to write down information on the fly, without the need to do so in real life, and without the need to lose control of the game by writing on a note outside the game. The original mod was created by someone else, however I found the mod in a stale state and therefore took it upon myself to update the mod and make it playable again.

After a short while, I began making additions to the mod in an attempt at making it easier to use and more performant. This process is still on-going, however I have taken a break from developing it for the last year and a half.

After beginning to work on the mod, another person offered to help develop the mod to a better state. Together we not only worked on the mod, but also accepted pull requests from other strangers who made additions and donated translations for the mod.
