# The Production of the Naturpark Pürkersdorf WordPress Theme
As part of one of my many modules at the University in Austria, I was assigned to a group and we were tasked with creating a WordPress website for a real client. We were given _Naturpark Pürkersdorf_ as our client. Besides the actual development, there were a number of professional formalities with the clients we were required to go through. This included setting up meetings with the clients and constantly liaising with them during production.

## The Development
My part in this group, as I had significant previous experience with working with WordPress, was to take the designs, templates and assets which the other team members produced and build the WordPress theme from scratch. As a starter template of the theme, I used [Underscores.me](http://underscores.me) to generate the basic files required for a WordPress template.

We used several Wordpress plugins to aid in creating specific elements of the site. Without these plugins we would have had to dive into service specific API #, writing our own code to interpret the data received, etc. 

Plugins used:
[Simple Calendar](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/google-calendar-events/) - Used to generate a more aesthetic calendar than a default Google Calendar embed would have given us
[WCP OpenWeather](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wcp-openweather/) - Used to generate attractive graphics and weather data manipulation
[Custom Facebook Feed](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-facebook-feed/) - Used to fetch and display posts made on the client's facebook page
